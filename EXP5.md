# Ex.No: 5 Write a program in Python language to search a given element is present in the list using Binary search. Introspect the causes for its failure and write down the possible reasons for its failure.

# DATE: 04-03-2025
# REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040176

### AIM: 
Write a python program to check the number is Armstrong number or not and inspect for failures.

### Algorithm:

1.  Start the program.
2.	Read an integer input number.
3.	Initialize the variables current_digit, sum = 0, and num = number.
4.	Repeat Steps 5 to 7 until num > 0
5.	current_digit = (num % 10).
6.	sum = sum + (current_digit * current_digit * current_digit). 7. Stop the program.
7.	num = num / 10.
8.	Check if sum == number. If true, print "It is an Armstrong Number." Otherwise, print "It is not an Armstrong Number."
9.	Stop the program.

### Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, x):  
    low = 0 
    high = len(arr) - 1 
    mid = 0 
    while low <= high: 
        mid = (high + low) // 2  
        if arr[mid] < x: 
            low = mid + 1 
        elif arr[mid] > x: 
            high = mid - 1 
        else: 
            return mid
    return -1 
 
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10,40 ] 
x = input("Enter the element to be searched: ");  
try: 
    x = int(x) 
    result = binary_search(arr, x)  
    if result != -1: 
          print("Element is present at index",str(result)) 
    else: 
          print("Element is not present in array") 
except: 
    print("Enter a valid input!")
```

### Output:

### Result:
Thus, the python program to check the number is Armstrong number or not implemented and the output is verified successfully.
